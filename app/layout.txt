LAYOUT: CONSIDER TABS for SKILLS & TOOLBOX

- Each would show a list of skills categorised using a Masonry/Isotope style layout with some basic filters
- Consider using dots or dashes or hearts and colours as some sort of indicator for proficiency level (e.g. I'm Pretty Good at this, I'm still learning etc.)
- Cards for each skill could be inspired by retro gaming UI with the indicator for life/health appearing as the proficiency level
